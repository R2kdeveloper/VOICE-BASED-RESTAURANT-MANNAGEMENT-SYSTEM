# VOCAL DINE AI – Voice‑Based Smart Dining (IoT + AI)

VOCAL DINE AI is an intelligent voice‑based dining assistant that integrates Artificial Intelligence with IoT devices to automate and enhance the dining experience.  The system enables users to control and manage dining‑related activities through voice commands, improving convenience, accessibility, and efficiency in restaurant or smart‑home dining environments. 

## 🚀 Features

- Voice‑based interaction for ordering and dining control. 
- Integration of AI with IoT devices for smart automation. 
- Real‑time response to user commands (e.g., placing orders, triggering specific dining actions). 
- Designed for use in restaurants or smart homes to reduce manual intervention. 

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning** (for voice understanding and decision logic) 
- **IoT platforms/devices** for automation and control 
- **Python** (assumed for AI and integration logic)
- Speech recognition / text‑to‑speech APIs or libraries

## 📋 System Workflow

1. **Voice Input**: User gives a voice command (e.g., place/modify order, control dining function) 
2. **AI Processing**: Speech-to-text conversion and intent extraction 
3. **IoT Integration**: Sends appropriate signals/commands to connected devices 
4. **User Feedback**: Voice/display confirmation of executed action 

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Restaurant Ordering**: Voice‑based menu ordering and order management 
- **Smart Home Dining**: Automated lighting, ambiance, and notification control 
- **Accessibility**: Hands‑free solution for users with mobility challenges
