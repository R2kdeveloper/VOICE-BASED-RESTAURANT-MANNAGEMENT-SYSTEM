# VOCAL DINE AI – Voice‑Based Smart Dining (IoT + AI)

VOCAL DINE AI is an intelligent voice‑based dining assistant that integrates Artificial Intelligence with IoT devices to automate and enhance the dining experience.[file:1] The system enables users to control and manage dining‑related activities through voice commands, improving convenience, accessibility, and efficiency in restaurant or smart‑home dining environments.[file:1]

## 🚀 Features

- Voice‑based interaction for ordering and dining control.[file:1]
- Integration of AI with IoT devices for smart automation.[file:1]
- Real‑time response to user commands (e.g., placing orders, triggering specific dining actions).[file:1]
- Designed for use in restaurants or smart homes to reduce manual intervention.[file:1]

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning** (for voice understanding and decision logic)[file:1]
- **IoT platforms/devices** for automation and control[file:1]
- **Python** (assumed for AI and integration logic)
- Speech recognition / text‑to‑speech APIs or libraries

## 📋 System Workflow

1. **Voice Input**: User gives a voice command (e.g., place/modify order, control dining function)[file:1]
2. **AI Processing**: Speech-to-text conversion and intent extraction[file:1]
3. **IoT Integration**: Sends appropriate signals/commands to connected devices[file:1]
4. **User Feedback**: Voice/display confirmation of executed action[file:1]

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Restaurant Ordering**: Voice‑based menu ordering and order management[file:1]
- **Smart Home Dining**: Automated lighting, ambiance, and notification control[file:1]
- **Accessibility**: Hands‑free solution for users with mobility challenges[file:1]
